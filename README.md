# Probabilistic Numerics

Archive of personal implementations of probabilistic numerical methods. A large part is based on Hennig, Osborne and Kersting's book ["Probabilistic Numerics"](https://www.probabilistic-numerics.org/textbooks/).

Warning: This is not a software package. These implementations are just for me to better understand these algorithms. It may be challenging to apply this code as some filters contain hard-coded choices.
